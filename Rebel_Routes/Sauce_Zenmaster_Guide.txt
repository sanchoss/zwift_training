  HOW TO USE SAUCE ZENMASTER FOR CUSTOM ROUTES
============================================================

SETUP
-----
1. Install Sauce for Zwift from https://www.sauce.llc/
2. Launch Sauce — it runs alongside Zwift as an overlay
3. Install Zenmaster mod:
   Sauce Settings → MODS tab → Sauce Official Mod Store → install Zenmaster

LOADING A CUSTOM ROUTE
-----------------------
1. Open the Custom Route Builder window (Zenmaster mod window)
2. Select the world from the dropdown (e.g., Watopia)
3. Load a route:
   - Click "Saved routes" dropdown → select a previously saved route
   - Or import a .json route file
   - Or draw a route manually by clicking roads on the map
4. The route appears on the map in red/orange with distance and elevation shown
5. Left panel shows Waypoints and Cuesheet tabs

ACTIVATING NAVIGATION
----------------------
1. Once the route is loaded in Custom Route Builder, click the "Finish" button
   — this publishes the route for navigation (auto-steering)
2. In Zwift, select the matching world and a spawn route that places you
   near the route start (see spawnPoint.routes in the JSON)
3. Start riding — Zenmaster will automatically make all turns for you
4. Use "Reset" to clear waypoints, "Undo" to remove last point,
   "Clear from Sauce" to remove the route entirely

JSON ROUTE FORMAT
-----------------
The route file contains:
- courseId    — Zwift world (6 = Watopia)
- manifest   — ordered list of road segments (roadId, start/end positions, reverse)
- spawnPoint — which official Zwift routes place you at the correct starting location

CREATING NEW ROUTE FILES
--------------------------
- Sauce Route Builder (built into Zenmaster UI) — visually click roads on the map
- Manual JSON — if you know the road IDs (visible in Sauce's road debug overlay)
- Community shared routes — many rebel routes are shared as JSON files

TIPS
----
- If the route doesn't auto-steer, make sure Navigator is enabled in Zenmaster
- You can pause/resume navigation mid-ride
- The route won't appear in Zwift's official HUD — only in Sauce's overlay
- For rebel routes, completing the Strava segment is what counts,
  so make sure GPS recording is on
